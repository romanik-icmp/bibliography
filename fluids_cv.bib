An explicit expression for the functional integral form of the partition function in the grand canonical ensemble is obtained. The functional integral is defined on a set of the collective variables (CV). The variable ϱk corresponds to the density vibration mode with the wave vector k. It is shown that in the vicinity of the critical point, for all k larger than some B, the CV are distributed with the Gaussian measure density. In the long wave region, k < B, the surfaces of the cumulants consisting of the correlation functions of some reference system (the reference system is a model system of particles with repulsive pair interactions) possess wide plateaus in the vicinity of the point k = 0. It is shown that due to these two facts the homogeneous system can be put in correspondance with a certain lattice system with spacing c = πB. The problem of the calculation of the partition function can be reduced to the calculation of the functional for a three-dimensional Ising model with an external field.}

We have already proved (Kozitsky et al., 2018, 2020) the possibility of a mathematically rigorous transition from a continuous system of interacting particles to such a model and made an accurate calculation of its grand partition function. In the present research, we derive an explicit accurate equation of state of the cell model with Curie-Weiss potential. It turned out that this model has a sequence of first-order phase transitions at temperatures below the critical Tc. We analyzed the mechanism of these transitions based on the behavior of the chemical potential as a function of density. Thus we obtained the points of phase coexistence without going beyond the microscopic approach. We also proposed a mathematically strict definition of the critical temperature as a function of the microscopic parameters of the model. We determined the parameters of the critical points and plotted phase diagrams which cover the area of the first three phase transitions in the sequence.}

The thermodynamic coefficients (isothermal compressibility, density fluctuations, and thermal expansion) of sodium are investigated in the supercritical temperature region. Numerical calculations of thermodynamic coefficients are performed close to the critical point, where carrying out theoretical and experimental research is challenging. The change in compressibility with increasing density at various temperature values is traced. The behavior of density fluctuations approaching the critical point is shown for different temperatures. The variation in the magnitude of the thermal expansion with increasing temperature for different pressure values is illustrated.}
