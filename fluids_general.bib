  title = {Wavelength-dependent fluctuations in classical fluids: I. The long wavelength limit},
  journal = {Proceedings of the Physical Society},
  abstract = {A discussion is given of the properties of correlation functions for wavelength-dependent fluctuations of density, energy, stress, etc. in a classical fluid. Three separate but related  topics are treated: (i) the definition and properties of the correlation functions - in particular the consequences of the condition that they be stationary in time, (ii) the long wavelength limit, where expressions for thermodynamic derivatives are obtained from the correlation functions in terms of s-particle distribution functions and (iii) the definition of κ-dependent elastic moduli in a fluid. In an appendix it is shown that the results of (ii) are in accord with those derived from the equilibrium grand canonical ensemble.

A qualitative discussion of the time dependence of the correlation functions, and its relation to radiation scattering is given, and it is suggested that the κ-dependent moduli mentioned above might give the dispersion law for the high frequency excitations recently measured by Cocking and Egelstaff in liquid lead.}

The results are presented for three common van der Waals hard-core models (square-well, Yukawa, and Sutherland) and for the realistic Lennard-Jones fluid.}

	abstract = "{The different roles the attractive and repulsive forces play in forming the equilibrium structure of a Lennard‐Jones liquid are discussed. It is found that the effects of these forces are most easily separated by considering the structure factor (or equivalently, the Fourier transform of the pair‐correlation function) rather than the pair‐correlation function itself. At intermediate and large wave vectors, the repulsive forces dominate the quantitative behavior of the liquid structure factor. The attractions are manifested primarily in the small wave vector part of the structure factor; but this effect decreases as the density increases and is almost negligible at reduced densities higher than 0.65. These conclusions are established by considering the structure factor of a hypothetical reference system in which the intermolecular forces are entirely repulsive and identical to the repulsive forces in a Lennard‐Jones fluid. This reference system structure factor is calculated with the aid of a simple but accurate approximation described herein. The conclusions lead to a very simple prescription for calculating the radial distribution function of dense liquids which is more accurate than that obtained by any previously reported theory. The thermodynamic ramifications of the conclusions are presented in the form of calculations of the free energy, the internal energy (from the energy equation), and the pressure (from the virial equation). The implications of our conclusions to perturbation theories for liquids and to the interpretation of x‐ray scattering experiments are discussed.}",

We also compare two methods for determining the coordinates of the critical point. The first one, using the rectilinear diameter law, appears to be less accurate than the second one based on the heat capacity at constant volume. It is found that the critical temperature decreases as the range of the interactions increases and that the liquid-vapor coexistence disappears for λ greater than 6.}",

We present new simulation results for the compressibility and internal energy of this fluid. We use generalized perturbation theory to derive two new equations of state for the HCLJ fluid that provide accurate fits of the simulation compressibilities. One of these equations is novel in that it is based on a square well reference system, while the other is an extension of commonly used perturbed hard sphere equations of state. We also discuss the similarity between perturbation theory and generalized van der Waals theory.}
