  title = {Wavelength-dependent fluctuations in classical fluids: I. The long wavelength limit},
  journal = {Proceedings of the Physical Society},
  abstract = {A discussion is given of the properties of correlation functions for wavelength-dependent fluctuations of density, energy, stress, etc. in a classical fluid. Three separate but related  topics are treated: (i) the definition and properties of the correlation functions - in particular the consequences of the condition that they be stationary in time, (ii) the long wavelength limit, where expressions for thermodynamic derivatives are obtained from the correlation functions in terms of s-particle distribution functions and (iii) the definition of κ-dependent elastic moduli in a fluid. In an appendix it is shown that the results of (ii) are in accord with those derived from the equilibrium grand canonical ensemble.

A qualitative discussion of the time dependence of the correlation functions, and its relation to radiation scattering is given, and it is suggested that the κ-dependent moduli mentioned above might give the dispersion law for the high frequency excitations recently measured by Cocking and Egelstaff in liquid lead.}

It is found that the effects of these forces are most easily separated by considering the structure factor (or equivalently, the Fourier transform of the pair‐correlation function) rather than the pair‐correlation function itself. At intermediate and large wave vectors, the repulsive forces dominate the quantitative behavior of the liquid structure factor. The attractions are manifested primarily in the small wave vector part of the structure factor; but this effect decreases as the density increases and is almost negligible at reduced densities higher than 0.65. These conclusions are established by considering the structure factor of a hypothetical reference system in which the intermolecular forces are entirely repulsive and identical to the repulsive forces in a Lennard‐Jones fluid. This reference system structure factor is calculated with the aid of a simple but accurate approximation described herein. The conclusions lead to a very simple prescription for calculating the radial distribution function of dense liquids which is more accurate than that obtained by any previously reported theory. The thermodynamic ramifications of the conclusions are presented in the form of calculations of the free energy, the internal energy (from the energy equation), and the pressure (from the virial equation). The implications of our conclusions to perturbation theories for liquids and to the interpretation of x‐ray scattering experiments are discussed.}",

For small clusters bound by long-range interatomic forces, the lowest energy minimum has an amorphous structure typical of the liquidlike state.

The primary goal is to determine which of these offers the more useful criterion. The choice of origin can sometimes effect the significance of the index. We study three systems with two kinds of potentials. They are all composed of 64 particles: (a) and (b), a homopolymer and a cluster that consist of beads interacting pairwise through square-well potentials, and (c) a cluster of particles interacting pairwise through Morse potentials. For each of the noncrystalline structures, in contrast to the crystals originally studied by Lindemann, the fluctuation parameter based on interparticle distances gives a clearer separability of liquid and solid phases than that based on fluctuations from average positions. The solid-like forms of the Morse cluster, the square-well cluster, and the square-well homopolymer have similar behavior, indicating that a broad class of systems can be evaluated with this index. In these systems, relative fluctuation parameters provide a suitable criterion for the melting transition. The critical values for the interparticle distance criterion, which are in the range of 0.03–0.05, are smaller than those for the Lindemann criterion (0.1–0.15).}",

The Rayleigh instability limit separates between nearly binary (or tertiary) spatially unisotropic fission and spatially isotropic Coulomb explosion into a large number of small, ionic fragments. Implications are addressed for a broad spectrum of dynamics in chemical physics, radiation physics of ultracold gases, and biophysics, involving the fission of clusters and droplets, the realization of Coulomb explosion of molecular clusters, the isotropic expansion of optical molasses, and the Coulomb instability of “isolated” proteins.}

Morse clusters are particularly important for applications, but their global optimization is also an extremely hard problem, highly relevant to methods that are to be applied to find the optimal configuration of a biomolecule. In particular, large ρ values are very challenging and, until now, no unbiased global-optimization method has been able to detect all the (putative) global minima at ρ = 14 for clusters with up to N = 80 atoms. In this paper we introduce some techniques for transforming the original Morse potential that allow us to increase considerably the efficiency in locating the known global minima and also to discover some new optimal clusters. These methods are promising candidates for application to the optimization of biomolecules. }

	abstract = {Phase coexistence of Morse fluids is predicted for parameters in the range describing the behavior of metals using the grand-canonical transition matrix Monte Carlo method. The critical properties of the vapor–liquid equilibrium curves for three fcc metals, Al, Cu, and Au, and two bcc alkali metals, Na and K, are estimated and the critical temperature values are found to be in good agreement with the experimental data for the fcc metals considered but overestimated for the bcc metals. For Na, it was found that the critical density and vapor pressure as a function of temperature (below the critical temperature) estimates to be approximately concurrent with experimental results.}

	abstract = "{The vapor-liquid coexistence curve of Morse fluid was calculated within the integral equations approach. The critical point coordinates were estimated. The parameters of Morse potential, fitted for elastic constants in solid phase, were used here to apply the results of present calculations to the determination of iron binodal. The properties of copper and sodium were considered in an analogous way. The calculations of pair correlation functions and isobars at liquid phase have shown that only for sodium these potential parameters allow one to obtain agreement with the measurements data. For iron another parameters are necessary to get this agreement in liquid phase. However, they give rise to very low critical temperature and pressure with respect to the estimates of other authors. Consequently, one can suppose that Morse potential is possibly inapplicable to the calculation of high temperature properties of non-alkali metals in disordered phases.}",
