	abstract = {The collective variables method is used to calculate the order parameter for a 3D Ising-like model in the presence of an external field. The expressions obtained are explicit functions of temperature, the field and microscopic parameters of the model. Influence of the external field on the critical behavior of the order parameter is studied.}
